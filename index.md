# lorawan-model

This repo contains an accurate and configurable model to estimate the network performance of a [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) network with a single gateway.

Through multiple configurable parameters, the model allows the user to estimate the performance of LoRaWAN networks applying standard configurations, as well as to test innovative and more efficient options. 

Performances are computed in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and delays. An overview of the model structure, employed assumption and accepted input and outputs are described below.

The analytical model is written in Python, and its results can be easily compared to the simulation outcomes obtained through the ns-3 [lorawan](https://github.com/signetlabdei/lorawan) module.
